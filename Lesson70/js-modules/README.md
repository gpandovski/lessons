## Project setup

ES6 Modules works only via HTTP, to make it work you will need a HTTP server.  
To install simple javascript http-server run:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

### Run server

After you install javascript http server, navigate with terminal to project folder `cd C:\your-path-to-ca-git-files\Lesson70\js-modules `  
Run the server:

```
http-server
```

In terminal you will be informed on which IP and port server is running - you need to open it in your browser  
Now you can work with ESM modules
